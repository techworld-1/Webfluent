      <h2><a href="form.html">Project 1</a></h2>

      <p>The form typically includes fields for the student's full name, date of birth, gender, address, email address, phone number, and emergency contact information. It may also include fields for the student's educational background, such as their previous school or institution, academic achievements, and any relevant certifications or qualifications.
        The purpose of the student registration form is to collect accurate and complete information from students in a standardized format, making it easier for educational institutions to process registrations and manage student records efficiently
